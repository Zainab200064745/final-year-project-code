# Gaze-Based Annotation for Histopathology

## Overview
This project explores gaze-based annotation using synthetic gaze data to enhance pathologists' efficiency. The project initially used a single Gaussian distribution but later switched to a multi-Gaussian model for better accuracy.

## Usage
- Clone the repository and open the Colab notebook.
- Run the cells sequentially to generate synthetic gaze data.

## Results
- The multi-Gaussian approach yielded more realistic gaze heatmaps compared to the single Gaussian model.
